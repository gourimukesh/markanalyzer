Edu-Portal 2026: AI-Powered Academic Analyst
An intelligent educational portal designed to transform raw marksheets into deep pedagogical insights. Powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash, this application offers a specialized environment for both teachers and students to track progress, diagnose learning gaps, and share resources.

Core Functionality

Teacher Dashboard

The teacher dashboard is split into three high-impact zones:
Mode 1 (Analytics): Automated extraction of student data from standard PDF marksheets. Provides class-wide metrics, subject-wise averages, and individual performance overviews.
Mode 2 (Deep Diagnosis): Goes beyond scores. By analyzing question papers alongside marks, the AI identifies why marks were lost:
Concept error: Misunderstanding of the core topic.
Calculation mistake: Speed or accuracy errors.
Formula error: Incorrect application of mathematical rules.
Note Sharing: A centralized upload system to distribute study materials (PDFs/Docs) to the entire class instantly.

Student Dashboard (Privacy-First)

Designed for individual growth while maintaining strict data privacy:
Personal Data Isolation: Students select their name to see only their personal report. All other student data remains hidden.
Mode 1 View: Subject-wise performance graphs and AI-identified "Strengths" and "Weaknesses."
Mode 2 View: Question-by-question breakdown and specialized AI suggestions for improvement.
Resource Access: A dedicated download center for all teacher-published materials.
